simple translation - translates to the middle of the screen, draws an ellipse, then translates 100px to the right and down and draws again.

rotation - sets up a variable to track a rotation angle, increments it, and draws a rectangle at 0,0 after translating to the mouse position.

functions - like we did in class, this code makes a face using variables to store face positions, and a function to package everything together.

translation - uses the face drawing function from the 'functions' example and elaborates on it, using 'translate()' to draw it in multiple positions on the screen while still technically drawing at (0, 0).
