### Terminal basic commands

* '.' - the current directory
* '..' - the parent directory
* 'open' - tells the OS to open whatever the target is, e.g. 'open .' or 'open file.txt'
* 'cd' - change directory to target directory, e.g. 'cd Desktop/' or 'cd .' 'cd' by itself will change the directory to the root user folder.
* 'ls' - list the files in the current or target directory
